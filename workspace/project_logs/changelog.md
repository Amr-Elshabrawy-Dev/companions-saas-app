## [2025-09-22] Security Fix: Logout Session Cleanup

### Security Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Logout functionality was not clearing user session data, leaving companions, bookmarks, and session history accessible after logout
- **Impact**: Security vulnerability where user data persisted after authentication session ended

### Changes Made

#### 1. Custom Logout Handler (`components/Navbar.tsx`)
- Added custom `handleLogout` function that wraps Clerk's logout functionality
- Implemented session data cleanup before signing out from Clerk
- Added proper error handling with fallback logout if cleanup fails
- Added logout icon using Lucide React icons

#### 2. Session Cleanup API (`app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`)
- Created new API endpoint `/api/auth/logout` for secure session cleanup
- Clears user's session history from database on logout
- Clears user's bookmarks from database on logout (enhances privacy)
- **Important**: User-created companions are intentionally preserved as they are user-generated content
- Includes proper error handling and logging

#### 3. Client-Side State Management (`app/companions/CompanionsClientPage.tsx`)
- Added `useAuth` hook to listen for authentication state changes
- Implemented automatic client-side state clearing when user logs out
- Clears companion list, bookmarks, and error states on logout
- Ensures UI reflects logged-out state immediately
- **Enhanced Security**: Added authentication check to hide companions from logged-out users
- **User Experience**: Created dedicated sign-in prompt for logged-out users accessing companion library

### Security Improvements
- **Session Data Cleanup**: All temporary session data is cleared on logout
- **Privacy Enhancement**: Bookmarks are cleared to prevent data leakage
- **Client-Side Security**: UI state is reset to prevent information disclosure
- **Error Resilience**: Logout succeeds even if session cleanup encounters errors

### Files Modified
- `components/Navbar.tsx` - Added custom logout handler
- `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` - New API endpoint for session cleanup
- `app/companions/CompanionsClientPage.tsx` - Added client-side state clearing

### Testing Recommendations
- Test logout functionality to ensure session data is cleared
- Verify that user-created companions are preserved after logout/login cycle
- Check that bookmarks and session history are properly cleared
- Confirm client-side UI updates correctly on logout

### Notes
- User-created companions are intentionally preserved as they represent user-generated content
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- All changes follow security best practices for session management
